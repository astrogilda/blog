## 1 · Not all AI assistants are created equal

Structured‑logging retrofit? API migration across 50 micro‑services?  
The “best” assistant depends on:

* **Codebase context** it can ingest.  
* **Model flexibility** (GPT‑4, Claude, Mixtral, local Llama…).  
* **Security & privacy** posture.  
* **Multi‑file apply** UX and cost.

## 2 · Core trade‑offs

| Dimension | Why it matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| Code graph | Deep understanding means fewer hallucinated edits. |
| Model choice | Ability to switch models for cost / latency / licence. |
| Deployment | Cloud SaaS vs self‑host vs fully local. |
| Refactor UX | Can it atomically modify dozens of files? |
| Cost | Pay‑per‑seat, pay‑per‑token, or free local? |

## 3 · Feature matrix (2025‑06)

| Tool | Best for | Code context | Multi‑file apply | Model choice | Security / privacy |
|------|----------|--------------|------------------|--------------|--------------------|
| **GitHub Copilot** | Fast single‑pattern edits, individual productivity | Good – open tabs + @workspace | Possible, needs prompt iterations | Closed (OpenAI GPT‑4 Turbo) | Cloud SaaS |
| **Sourcegraph Cody** | Deep architectural / multi‑repo refactors | **Excellent** – full code graph | Native “Smart Apply”, atomic | Flexible (Claude, GPT‑4, Gemini) | Self‑host option |
| **OpenRouter CLI (`cline`)** | Model‑agnostic experiments, pay‑as‑you‑go | Good – current workspace | CLI patch apply; scripted | 80+ models selectable | Cloud (choose regional) |
| **Continue + llama.cpp** | Totally offline, GPU / CPU local dev | Local file set | VS Code context actions | Any GGUF model (Mistral, Phi‑3…) | Code never leaves laptop |
| **Tabnine** | Fast autocomplete, privacy | Good – local + cloud hybrid | Limited to single file | Multiple LLMs incl. local engine | On‑prem/fully local mode |

---

## 4 · Recommendations

* **Copilot** – quickest ROI for patterned edits (eg. structured‑logging retrofit).  
* **Cody** – enterprise‑wide API migrations; needs full dependency graph.  
* **OpenRouter** – want Mixtral for fuzzy search today, Claude tomorrow; low fixed cost.  
* **Continue + Llama** – air‑gapped servers, defense clients, or hack‑on‑a‑plane with no internet.  
* **Tabnine** – teams prioritising private autocomplete with minimal setup.

> **Toolkit mindset:** treat assistants as interchangeable plugins—pick per task, not per ideology.

## 5 · Next steps

1. Trial at least **two** assistants on the *same* refactor, compare diff quality.  
2. Pair your chosen AI with **Ruff** (quality) + **mutmut** (safety) gates.  
3. Iterate prompts; store successful refactor prompts in a team “prompt library”.
